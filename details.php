            <h3>Summary of act 1 </h3>
            The book begins at King's Cross Station, with Harry's and Hermione’s respective children—Albus Potter and Rose Granger-Weasley—going off to Hogwarts for the first time. 
            Albus is afraid he will break the family tradition and be sorted into Slytherin rather than Gryffindor. 
            On the Hogwarts Express, Albus makes friends with Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Draco Malfoy.
             Scorpius is sorted into Slytherin, then in a complete surprise Albus Potter is sorted into Slytherin. 
             Rose is sorted into Gryffindor and becomes popular as Albus shows no particular magical aptitude, thus widening the distance between her and her cousin Albus. 
            Scorpius and Albus are friends, but rumors about Scorpius's birth cause him to be an outcast.
            Draco Malfoy is tormented by rumors that Voldemort used a Time-Turner to impregnate his wife Astoria to give birth to Scorpius. 
            He asks Harry Potter for a statement that all Time-Turners have all been destroyed. 
            Harry is then visited by Amos Diggory and his niece Delphi, who each want Harry to go back in time to the Triwizard tournament and save his son, Cedric, since he was an innocent victim of Lord Voldemort.
            Over a holiday, Harry arrives to give Albus a present: his own baby blanket. The gesture feels empty; Albus and Harry argue about Albus’s difficulties at school and Harry says he sometimes wishes Albus wasn’t his son. Albus leaves to go back to Hogwarts and Harry’s scar begins to hurt for the first time in nineteen years.
